# VLC Player in PyQt5
This example demonstrates an embedded VLC player in Qt using PyQt5. the Python VLC binding file is included in this repo and can be found online [here](https://wiki.videolan.org/Python_bindings).

The example is based on the (older) example provided by VLC but uses the new PyQt5 signal/slot syntax.
